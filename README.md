It is advisable to add the program to `PATH` environmental variable to use it from anywhere.

**Example 1:**

Launches Arma with CBA from P-drive, ACE3 from Workshop install and ACRE2 from local development folder. Additionally builds ACRE2 mod and opens the latest log file. Loads Arma directly into editor using the specified mission from "Soldier" profile.

```
$ armaqdl.py p:x\cba workshop:@ace dev:acre2:b -m Soldier:test.vr
```

Specific build tool can also be specified, such as HEMTT:
```
$ armaqdl.py p:x\cba workshop:@ace dev:acre2:hemtt -m Soldier:test.vr
```

**Example 2:**

Launches Arma Server with CBA from P-drive and loads specified mission from root `MPMissions` folder.

```
$ armaqdl.py p:x\cba -m test.vr -s
```

Launches Arma with CBA from P-drive and connects to the given server with given password (`-j` defaults to `localhost:2302:test`).

```
$ armaqdl.py p:x\cba -j 192.168.1.1:2302:test
```
